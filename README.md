# Characterization of Murine Astrocyte Cultures in 3D Hydrogel Matrices

## Project Overview
This repository contains Python notebooks for data analysis and processing used in the study: **"Characterization of Murine Astrocyte Cultures in 3D Hydrogel Matrices"** by *Maria Beatriz Sereno Fernandes* (Instituto Superior Técnico, February 2025).

### Key Contributions
- **Experimental Analysis:**
  - Evaluation of murine astrocyte behavior in different 3D hydrogel environments (alginate and fibrin-based).
  - Analysis of cell viability, morphology, and astrocytic marker expression (GFAP and SOX9).

- **Computational Tools:**
  - 2D and 3D nuclei segmentation using a deep learning model (nnU-Net).

- **GUI Development:**
  - A graphical user interface (GUI) for automatic nuclei detection and multi-label cell classification.
